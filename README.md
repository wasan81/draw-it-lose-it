# Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
Creative Technology Solutions (CTS) has recently taken on a new client, The Gaming Room. The Gaming Room wants to develop a web-based game that serves multiple platforms based on their current game, Draw It or Lose It, which is currently available in an Android app only.
 We need to prepare a software design document and begin developing the game application, addressing their software requirements such as making a game ability one or more teams with multiple players for each team. Also, the game and team must be unique to allow users to check whether a name is in use when choosing a team name.

# What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
# What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
# How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
