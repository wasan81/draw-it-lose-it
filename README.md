# Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
Creative Technology Solutions (CTS) has recently taken on a new client, The Gaming Room. The Gaming Room wants to develop a web-based game that serves multiple platforms based on their current game, Draw It or Lose It, which is currently available in an Android app only.
 We need to prepare a software design document and begin developing the game application, addressing their software requirements such as making a game ability one or more teams with multiple players for each team. Also, the game and team must be unique to allow users to check whether a name is in use when choosing a team name.

# What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I helped The Gaming Room expand their software by creating detailed documentation. This involved analyzing system architectures, selecting an operating platform, managing storage and memory, establishing communication between platforms, and prioritizing user protection and security.
# What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
UML is a way to visually represent an application's design using shapes and diagrams. It helps me understand code relationships and how data fits together. Commercial tools can translate UML diagrams into code.
# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
It was difficult for me to suggest recommendations for the gaming room. I had to conduct extensive online research to find the best description of operating system architectures and analyze the different file system components that make up a collection of data. Additionally, I explained the functions of memory and storage management, identified various memory management techniques, and described distributed systems and the networks that connect them.

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
Considering user needs is crucial for creating successful software. It leads to easy-to-use interfaces, efficient workflows, and satisfied users. Prioritizing users can differentiate software from competitors and drive game success.# How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
